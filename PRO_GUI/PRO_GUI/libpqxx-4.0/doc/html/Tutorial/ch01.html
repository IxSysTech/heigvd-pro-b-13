      <span class="productname">libpqxx</span>™ is a C++ <acronym class="acronym">API</acronym> to
      <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span>™.  It replaces the earlier
      <span class="productname">libpq++</span>™ with a more Standard Template Library
      (<acronym class="acronym">STL</acronym>)-conformant interface and makes more extensive use
      of C++ language features such as exceptions, templates, and strings.
    </p><p>
      Since <span class="productname">libpqxx</span>™ builds on top of the C frontend
      <span class="productname">libpq</span>™, you will need a working
      <span class="productname">libpq</span>™ library on your system prior to getting
      started with <span class="productname">libpqxx</span>™.  This is similar to the
      situation with the older <span class="productname">libpq++</span>™ interface.
    </p><p>
      See the <a class="ulink" href="http://pqxx.org/" target="_top"><span class="productname">libpqxx</span>™
      website</a> for more information.

        Several open-source C++ wrapper libraries are available for various
        databases, as well as some database-independent ones; there's
        <span class="productname">libpql++</span>™, <span class="productname">libpq++</span>™,
        <span class="productname">libsqlxx</span>™ and so on.
      </p><p>
        So was <span class="productname">libpqxx</span>™ really necessary?
      </p><p>
        I think it is.  The C++ Standard, and its standard library in
        particular, have stabilized over the mid-1990s; compilers and standard
        library implementations are still following suit at the time of writing.
        As a result, most older third-party libraries suffer from symptoms such
        as:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>
	    Not using exceptions.  Many libraries return a status code and
            expect callers to check for errors "if they're interested."
            <span class="emphasis"><em>Of course</em></span> they're interested.  But checking
            each and every call is tedious and error prone.
	  </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	    Ad-hoc exception classes.  Programs using C++ libraries need to deal
	    with various incompatible exception class hierarchies, and error
	    handling becomes a total nightmare with multiple essentially
            identical <code class="literal">catch</code> clauses for every
            <code class="literal">try</code> block.
	  </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	    Ad-hoc string classes.  As one member of the C++ standards committee
	    put it, if the C++ wasn't going to have a standard string class,
            "there will be blood in the streets."  Luckily the committee saw
            the wisdom in this, and civilization was spared.
	  </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	    "A Better C."  Using only the oldest features of C++ as extensions
            to the C language really only complicates things, but there was a
            time when this was the only way to write portable C++.
	  </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	    Ad-hoc containers and algorithms.  Inventing your own container
            APIs, interesting as it may be, in most cases is wasted development
            effort.  Besides that, there's also the redundant effort of having
            to learn how they work.
	  </p></li></ul></div><p>
        For these reasons, third-party libraries have tended to grow into
        intrusive frameworks.  Third-party code, and class libraries in
        particular, need to be rewritten to replace such ad-hockery with the
        rich and standardized functionality now provided by C++.  This is what
        <span class="productname">libpqxx</span>™ intends to do for
        <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span>™.  The library was designed to be a
        forward-looking one, which means that ports to vendor X's compiler Y may
        have to wait until X improves its support of the Standard.
      </p><p>
        But there were other reasons to design a new SQL frontend from scratch.
        C++ is a complex language, and the only things stopping library writers
        from shooting themselves in the feet are years of experience and an
        extensive idiom of good practices.  To name a few typical symptoms of
        foot-shooting:
      </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>
	    Poor language integration.  Users need to learn myriads of function
	    names when standard C++ operators can be overloaded instead to make
	    code fit in more naturally with the core language.
	  </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	    Overdoing overloading.  It's also easy to go overboard with operator
	    or function overloading, and many classes do.  Some programmers use
	    identical function names to mean very different things, or define
	    operators whose semantics are not clearly derived from their
	    conventional meanings.
	  </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	    Resource management.  In the complex world of C++, what the user
	    really needs from a library is a little help in ensuring that
            objects are deleted at the proper time, pointers don't go off into
            never-never land, and so on.  Perhaps the most compelling aspect of
            C++ is the "resource acquisition is initialization" paradigm, but
            too few libraries apply it as yet.
	  </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	    Convoluted family trees.  Class derivation is a beautiful thing, but
	    it can be overused.  Some libraries construe far-fetched relations
	    between classes, or needlessly expose "convenience" relations using
	    public inheritance.
	  </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	    Overweight classes.  Some classes lump together different pieces of
	    functionality with different lifetimes.  For instance, some C++ SQL
	    libraries integrate transaction bracketing into a connection class.
	    Yet it is not unreasonable for an application to perform multiple
	    consecutive transactions using the same connection.
	  </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
	   Exposure of low-level interfaces.  Some C++ wrappers for C-level SQL
	   interface libraries (including <span class="productname">libpq++</span>™)
	   don't hide the ugly details of the underlying API.  Worse, some only
	   provide "utility" classes that the user can mix in freely with
           C-level function calls.
	  </p></li></ul></div><p>
        Again, <span class="productname">libpqxx</span>™ is an attempt to do better.
        Hopefully this has resulted in a library that is easier to use than most
        alternatives while giving you more flexibility, that helps you avoid
        common pitfalls and reduces the need for debugging.
